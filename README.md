# cocktail-js-app
cocktail database to query recipes - implemented in javascript

To build a small web application with __HTML__, __CSS__, and __JavaScript__ that loads data from an _external API_ and _enables the viewing of data points_ in detail.

## Features and Requirements User Goals
Your users should be able to view a list of data and see more details for a given data item on demand. It’s up to you to come up with a type of data you want to display (see this list of public APIs for an example); however, if you don’t have any special preferences, you can write a small Pokédex app to display a list of Pokémon.

## Key Features
* Load data from an external source (API)
* View a list of items
* On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item

## Technical Requirements
### Required:
* The app must load data from an external API; for instance, the Pokémon API.
* The app must display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
* The app must enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on
demand, such as when clicking on a list item.
* The app must have CSS styling.
* The JavaScript code must be formatted according to ESLint rules.
* The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier.
* The JavaScript code may be manually formatted.
* The app must use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or
touch interactions.
* ○ The app may allow searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).
* ● The app must not throw any errors when being used.
* ● The app should be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you can
review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, &
Web Hosting).
* ● The app must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.

### _Nice to Have:_
* ● The app should show loading indicators while loading data.
* ● The app should handle errors (such as trying to load data while offline) and show user-friendly
error messages.
