# pok√©dex-js-app

To build a small web application with __HTML__, __CSS__, and __JavaScript__ that loads data from an _external API_ and _enables the viewing of data points_ in detail.


### Description
* This project was part of the Career Foundry Full Stack Web Development course. It's a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

* The app displays a searchable list of pokemon names. When the user clicks on the name of a pokemon, a modal appears displaying further details on the pokemon (image, height, weight, and types) fetched from an external API.

The app uses the following API to load information on pokemon: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150

The app uses Bootstrap for styling purposes.
